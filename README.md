# ENFORCEMENT TRAILER

Welcome to an executive summary of this project. 

# Files

The following folder above shows the repository for the project including the technical report, datasheet for the equipment used, and images.

# Overview
VITRONIC’s enforcement Trailer is the ultimate solution for effective traffic monitoring in areas that are too hazardous for operators or lacking appropriate infrastructure. In the same way conventional trailers are transported, the enforcement trailer can be easily repositioned to any location to monitor traffic autonomously over several days. It can be rapidly set up and includes a remote-controlled drive-in order to minimize any physical risks to operators while it is being positioned on the roadside. Furthermore, the enforcement trailer has optimum protections against potential vandalism.

Autonomous, unmanned enforcement operation (up to ten days)

Suitable for transport by virtually any vehicle with a tow bar » High protection against vandalism

Remote-controlled drive for convenient positioning and on-the-spot maneuverings

Optionally integrated modem for wirelessly transmitting case data and remotely accessing the POLISCAN system

# Problem Statement
The enforcement trailer can run autonomously and continuously for a total period of 10 days based on the current battery solution of the system. The operation/running time must be extended and pushed to a minimum requirement of a month with uninterrupted operation. Exploring different viable options that will be discussed later into the document will provide insight how a solar solution provides a better adaptability of the system both sustainably and economically.

# The System

The system is now an off-grid solar augmentation of Vitronic's enforcement trailer that implements autonomous traffic monitoring and enforcement with an alternative solar PV system as a power source.
